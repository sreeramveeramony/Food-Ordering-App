# Food-Ordering-App
Diet Foods — Mini Full-Stack (Vue + Vuetify + Express + MongoDB)  A tiny learning project for a diet food store. It has two pages:  Store (client): Browse foods, choose Pickup/Delivery, place an order  Admin: Add foods and view orders  Designed to be minimal but not messy—clear separation between frontend and backend, with simple Mongo persistence.
